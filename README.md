# Point-Network-Switch

Tool is created to save networks and easily change between them, two files exist the cpp used to build the actual app if you wanted to make tweaks and the .exe if your not a programmer just download the .exe and run it. The app must be ran as admin so it can write/read files correctly I put this in the build but sometimes it does not listen to those instructions.
